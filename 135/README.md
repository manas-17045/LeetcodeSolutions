The Python files in this directory solve the "Candy" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks for the minimum number of candies to give to children lined up in a row, based on their ratings. The rules are that each child must have at least one candy, and children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors. Both files present a `Solution` class with a `candy` method that takes a list of ratings and returns the minimum number of candies required. The two files implement different approaches to solving this problem.
