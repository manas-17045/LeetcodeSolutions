        Calculates the sum of imbalance numbers for all possible subarrays of the given array.
        An imbalance number for a subarray is defined as the number of segments formed by
        consecutive elements when the subarray is sorted, minus one.

        Args:
            nums (list[int]): The input list of integers.
        Returns:
            int: The total sum of imbalance numbers across all subarrays.
