The Python files in this directory solve the "Domino and Tromino Tiling" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks for the number of ways to tile a 2xN board using 2x1 dominoes and L-shaped trominoes. Both Python scripts use dynamic programming to solve this problem. They define states for fully tiling a 2xi board and partially tiling it, then use recurrence relations to calculate the number of ways for a 2xN board. The solutions are optimized for space by only keeping track of the results for the previous two columns. The two files present the same logic with slightly different variable names.
