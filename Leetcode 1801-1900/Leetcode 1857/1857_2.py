        """
        Given a directed graph where each node has a color, return the largest
        value of a path in the graph. The value of a path is the number of nodes
        of the most frequent color in that path. If the graph contains a cycle,
        return -1.

        This problem can be solved using dynamic programming and topological sort.
        We use a DP table `dp[i][c]` to store the maximum count of color `c` on
        any path ending at node `i`. We perform a topological sort to process
        nodes in a valid order. For each node `u` popped from the queue, we
        update its DP entry for its own color and then propagate its DP values
        to its neighbors `v`. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, we add it
        to the queue. If we process all nodes, the maximum value in the DP table
        is the answer. Otherwise, there is a cycle.
