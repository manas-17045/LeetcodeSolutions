The Python files in this directory solve the "K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order" problem from LeetCode. This problem asks to find the k-th smallest number in the range from 1 to n when the numbers are sorted lexicographically. Both Python scripts implement a solution that simulates a walk on a 10-ary tree (a trie), where each node represents a number. By calculating the number of nodes in the subtrees, the algorithm efficiently navigates to the k-th number without generating all numbers. The two files provide slightly different implementations of this core idea.
