The Python files in this directory solve the "Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks to partition an array `nums` into two non-empty subarrays, `left` and `right`, such that every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`. The goal is to find the smallest possible length of the `left` subarray. Both Python scripts implement a clever one-pass solution. They iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far in the potential `left` partition (`maxInLeft` or `left_max`) and the overall maximum value seen so far (`currentMax` or `max_seen`). If they encounter a number that is smaller than `maxInLeft`, it means the partition must be extended to include this number. When the partition is extended, `maxInLeft` is updated to the current overall maximum to ensure the condition is met. The two files provide essentially the same logic with slightly different variable names.
