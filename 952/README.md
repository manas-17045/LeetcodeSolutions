The Python files in this directory solve the "Largest Component Size by Common Factor" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks for the size of the largest connected component in a graph where the nodes are the numbers from the input list `nums`, and an edge exists between two numbers if they share a common factor greater than 1. Both Python scripts solve this problem by using a Union-Find data structure to group the numbers. The key idea is to connect numbers to their prime factors. If two numbers share a prime factor, they will belong to the same connected component. The first solution precomputes the smallest prime factor for all numbers up to the maximum value in `nums` using a sieve, and then unions each number with its prime factors. The second solution finds the prime factors of each number and uses a dictionary to keep track of the first time a prime factor is seen, unioning subsequent numbers with the first one. Both approaches correctly solve the problem, with slight differences in their prime factorization and Union-Find implementation details.
