The Python files in this directory solve the "Similar String Groups" problem from LeetCode. The problem requires grouping a list of strings, where two strings are considered "similar" if one can be obtained from the other by swapping exactly two characters. The number of such groups is the desired output. Both Python scripts correctly model this problem as finding the number of connected components in a graph, where the strings are vertices and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding strings are similar. They both use a Union-Find (or Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently group the strings. The core logic in both files is to iterate through all pairs of strings, check for similarity, and if they are similar, union their sets. The final number of disjoint sets is the answer. The two implementations of the Union-Find algorithm are slightly different (one uses path compression and union by rank, the other just path compression), but they achieve the same result.
