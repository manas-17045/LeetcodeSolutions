The Python files in this directory solve the "Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters" problem from LeetCode. The goal is to find the length of the longest substring of a given string `s` where every character in the substring appears at least `k` times. The two provided solutions use different strategies: one employs a divide-and-conquer approach, while the other uses a sliding window technique.
