The Python files in this directory solve the "Array of Doubled Pairs" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks if an array of even length can be reordered such that for every `i`, `arr[2*i + 1] = 2 * arr[2*i]`. In other words, can the array be partitioned into pairs where one element is double the other. Both Python scripts solve this problem by first counting the occurrences of each number in the array. They then iterate through the numbers sorted by their absolute value. For each number `x`, they check if there are enough `2*x` values to form pairs. If not, they return `False`. Otherwise, they "consume" the required number of `2*x` values and continue. The sorting by absolute value is a key step to ensure that smaller numbers are paired up first, which is necessary for the greedy approach to work correctly. The two solutions are very similar, with minor differences in how they handle the zero case and the loop structure.
