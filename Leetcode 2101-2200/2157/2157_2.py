        """
        Groups strings based on specific transformation rules and returns the number of groups
        and the size of the largest group.

        Two strings are in the same group if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence
        of operations:
        1. Adding a character not present in the string.
        2. Deleting a character present in the string.
        3. Replacing a character with another character.

        Args:
            words: A list of strings.
        Returns:
            A list containing two integers: [number_of_groups, size_of_largest_group].
