The Python files in this directory solve the "Smallest Rotation with Highest Score" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks to find the best rotation `k` of an array `nums` that maximizes the score. The score is the number of elements `nums[i]` that are less than or equal to their index `i` after the rotation. Both Python scripts use a difference array (or a similar "change" array) to efficiently calculate the score for each possible rotation. Instead of recomputing the score from scratch for each `k`, they determine the intervals of `k` for which each element `nums[i]` contributes to the score. By marking the start and end of these intervals in the change array, they can compute all scores in a single pass. The two files implement this same core logic with minor variations in how they set up and process the change array.
