The Python files in this directory solve the "Shifting Letters" problem from LeetCode. The problem involves a string `s` and an array `shifts` of the same length. The value `shifts[i]` represents a shift to be applied to the first `i+1` letters of the string. The task is to return the final string after all shifts have been applied. Both Python scripts correctly solve this problem by first calculating the total shift for each character. They do this by iterating from right to left, accumulating the shifts. Then, they apply the calculated total shift to each character to get the final result. The two files implement this logic in a very similar way, with only minor differences in variable names and comments.
