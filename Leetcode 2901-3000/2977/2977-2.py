class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, source: str, target: str, original: list[str], changed: list[str], cost: list[int]) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the minimum cost to transform the source string into the target string
        using a given set of character/substring transformations.

        Args:
            source (str): The original string to be transformed.
            target (str): The desired target string.
            original (list[str]): A list of original substrings that can be transformed.
            changed (list[str]): A list of substrings that original[i] can be changed into.
            cost (list[int]): The cost to change original[i] to changed[i].

        Returns:
            int: The minimum cost to transform source to target. Returns -1 if transformation is not possible.
