        Calculates the number of coins to place in each tree node based on the costs of its descendants.

        For each node, we consider the costs of all nodes in its subtree.
        If the number of nodes in the subtree is less than 3, 1 coin is placed.
        Otherwise, we find the maximum product of three costs from the subtree.
        This maximum product can be either the product of the three largest positive costs
        or the product of the two smallest (most negative) costs and the largest positive cost.
        If the maximum product is negative or zero, 0 coins are placed.

        The solution uses a Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and collect the top 3 largest positive
        costs and the top 2 smallest negative costs from each subtree.
