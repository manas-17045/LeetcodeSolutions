The Python files in this directory solve the "Reverse Only Letters" problem from LeetCode. The problem requires reversing the English letters in a given string while keeping all other characters in their original positions. Both Python scripts implement a two-pointer approach to solve this problem. They initialize one pointer at the beginning of the string and another at the end. The pointers move towards each other, and when both pointers are at letters, the letters are swapped. If a pointer is at a non-letter character, it is skipped. This process continues until the pointers meet or cross, resulting in the letters being reversed in place. The two files present this logic with very minor stylistic differences.
