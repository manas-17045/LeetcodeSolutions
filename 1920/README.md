The Python files in this directory solve the "Build Array from Permutation" problem from LeetCode. The problem requires constructing a new array `ans` from a given array `nums` such that `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` for each index `i`. The two files demonstrate different ways to achieve this: one by using extra space to create a new array, and the other by modifying the input array in-place to save space.
