The Python files in this directory solve the "Snakes and Ladders" problem from LeetCode. The problem asks for the minimum number of moves to win a game of Snakes and Ladders on a given board. Both Python scripts solve this using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The board is treated as a directed graph where each square is a node, and a move from one square to another is an edge. The BFS explores the board level by level, guaranteeing that the first time the target square is reached, it will be via the shortest path. Both scripts include a helper function to convert the 1-dimensional square number into 2-dimensional board coordinates, accounting for the "Boustrophedon" (alternating direction) numbering of the squares. The two solutions are very similar in their approach and implementation.
