The Python files in this directory solve the "Longest Harmonious Subsequence" problem from LeetCode. A harmonious subsequence is defined as a subsequence where the difference between its maximum and minimum values is exactly 1. The task is to find the length of the longest such subsequence within a given array of integers. Both provided solutions use a hash map (or a `Counter`) to store the frequencies of each number in the input array. They then iterate through the unique numbers in the array, and for each number `x`, they check if `x + 1` also exists. If it does, they calculate the combined frequency of `x` and `x + 1` and keep track of the maximum sum found, which corresponds to the length of the longest harmonious subsequence. The two files offer nearly identical logic for solving this problem.
